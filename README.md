# AI-Upscaled-Textures-4K
Upscaled textures through AI for Rimworld. This repository is for 4x upscaled textures. The folders starting with "AI Upscaled Textures - " contain complete mods to use just like steam mods. Other folders only contain upscaled texture files for the relevant mod. To use those, copy-paste the texture folder into a working mod and activate. Dependencies, patches or edits to the About.xml are not necessary.

Please note that AI has its limitations, mainly on the textures that are not very detailed.
This will NOT replace the quality of textures designed by the talented Artist in this community, but at least it could be a cushion for pixelated textures.
