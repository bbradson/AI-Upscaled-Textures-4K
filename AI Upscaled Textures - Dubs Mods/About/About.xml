<description>Upscaled textures through AI for Rimatomics.

Please note that AI has its limitations, mainly on the textures that are not very detailed.
This will NOT replace the quality of textures designed by the talented Artist in this community, but at least it could be a cushion for pixelated textures.

Currently included mods:
- Dubs Bad Hygiene
- Rimatomics
- Rimefeller</description>
