# AI-Upscaled-Textures-Expanded-Animals-Only
Upscaled textures for VE-related animal mods. Somewhat outdated and messy.

This is a fairly huge collection with several thousand files, and only affects mods that use resolutions of 2x the vanilla one. RAM and VRAM usage is absolutely massive with this many textures upscaled to this kind of high resolution. Anything below 16GB RAM and 8GB VRAM is almost guaranteed to crash here.
Only use this if you really have a powerful PC and find those textures of Vanilla Expanded to be blurry on your high res monitor.

Currently included mods:
- Vanilla Expanded
- Sarg's Mods
- Vanilla Fan Made Expanded
- Biomes! Islands
- And some minor other ones that fit in
