# AI-Upscaled-Textures-4K-Low-Res-Animal-Mods

Upscaled textures through AI for various low res animal mods.

This AI upscaling generally yields fairly great results, though something looking out of place isn't gonna get magically rimworldified, unfortunately.
If you're playing with Camera+, these textures should be sharp enough to not look pixelated or blurry when fully zoomed in on a 4K monitor.
I've included fairly lightweight DDS files for use with AUTOMATIC's high quality textures mod, but regardless textures of this size use a certain amount of RAM.

Currently included mods:
- Legacy Ark
- Let's Have a Cat! - Version avoiding duplication with "VAE — Cats and Dogs"
- Pomeranian
- SparrowsMOD
- 狸 TANUKI
- MorrowRim
- Xen's Spirit Wolf
- Dire Wolf
- FFSmilodon caravaneer
