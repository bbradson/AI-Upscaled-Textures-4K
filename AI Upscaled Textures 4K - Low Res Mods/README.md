# AI-Upscaled-Textures-4K-Jecs-Mods

Upscaled textures through AI for various mods.

This AI upscaling generally yields fairly great results, though something looking out of place isn't gonna get magically rimworldified, unfortunately.
If you're playing with Camera+, these textures should be sharp enough to not look pixelated or blurry when fully zoomed in on a 4K monitor.
I've included fairly lightweight DDS files for use with AUTOMATIC's high quality textures mod, but regardless textures of this size use a certain amount of RAM.

Currently included mods:
- Primitive Storage
- Primitive Workbenches
- Snowy Trees
- SRTS Expanded
- [CP] Detailed Body Textures II
- Cybernetic Organism and Neural Network
- What the hack?!
- [RWY]SRTS Expanded: The Crimson Fleet
