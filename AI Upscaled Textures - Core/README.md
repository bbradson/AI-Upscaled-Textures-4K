# AI-Upscaled-Textures-Core

PLACEHOLDER TEXTURES

These are currently only 2x upscaled. An update is necessary.

---

Upscaled textures through AI for all core and royalty assets.

Most of the results are absolutely great, but please note that AI has its limitations, mainly on textures that are not very detailed.
This won't entirely transform the quality of textures designed by the talented artists of this community, but it will most of the time be a visible improvement when it comes to pixelated textures.

The game loads new textures for plants based on the folder name, making it imposible to change them without changing the folder paths.
So I split the plants textures into another mod to keep this mod's compatibility.

Includes:
- UI
- Effects
- Pawns
- Items
- Buildings
- Everything!
