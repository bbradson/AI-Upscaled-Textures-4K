# AI-Upscaled-Textures-Core

PLACEHOLDER TEXTURES

These are currently only 2x upscaled. An update is necessary.

---

Upscaled textures through AI for all core and royalty assets.

Please note that AI has its limitations, mainly on the textures that are not very detailed.
This will NOT replace the quality of textures designed by the talented Artist in this community, but at least it could be a cushion for pixelated textures.

The game loads new textures for plants based on the folder name, making it imposible to change them without changing the folder paths.
So I split the plants textures into another mod to keep this mod's compatibility.

Includes:
- UI
- Effects
- Pawns
- Items
- Buildings
- Everything!
